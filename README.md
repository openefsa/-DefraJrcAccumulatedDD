Accumulated day degrees by grid square for each year in the data set are generated as output
 Min, mean and maximum accumulated day degrees for each grid square across all input years also created
 The number and percentage of years out of the total years analysed which have an actual accumulated threshold greater than
 or equal to the accumulated threshold also included in the output.
 Maximum gap & max. run (max no. of consecutive years unsuitable/suitable) also calculated courtesy of Matt Upson
